        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          This website uses Google Analytics to track information regarding your
          use of the website. We may track information provided to us by your
          browser or use of the website, such as the website you came from
          (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the
          device from which you connected to the website, the time and date of
          access, and other information that does not personally identify you.
          We use this information for, among other things, the operation of the
          website, to maintain the quality of the website, to provide general
          statistics regarding use of the website and for other business

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We track this information in Google Analytics using cookies, or small
          text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are
          sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s
          computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us
          to collect Non-Personal Information about that user and keep a record
          of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an
          individual and aggregate basis. The Company may use both persistent
          and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after
          you close your session and until you delete them, while session
          cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies can be
          removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If
          you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the website may not work
          properly.
